A short bullet hell game written during my free time with the LibGDX library, this project isn't meant to be much more than a small test of my programming skills

The game is in a minimally playable state and requires a lot more features and content; but since this game doesn't require features that would exceed the capability of a modern game engine, it will no longer be updated or maintained due to time demand.
